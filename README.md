# AXE Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

AIP stands for AXE Improvement Proposal. Similar to Bitcoin's [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/), a AIP is a design document providing information to the AXE community, or describing a new feature for AXE or its processes or environment. The AIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.
